#find_children_from_marriage_wiewaswie

# In this function, try to find children. We can find children who eventually married directly from the
# input data.frame. However, it could also be possible to search for last name + place + time span from marriage
# To find any children. Those can be scraped and then filter to include only the certain children
# (With the right parental names)
